# Web Dev project - emporio

Website for emporio. A rigorous interschool commerce competition where teams from different schools participate. Made this for my school's corporate club being the Technical Head. Gave me a really good stepping stone towards modern web development and using libraries for the same. The 12th grade me was really proud of this, so I'd insist you check this out. Although, the current me sees a lot of things which could be done better.
